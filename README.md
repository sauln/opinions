# Opinion Dynamic Modeling

This is a playground for understanding and extending opinion dynamics models detailed
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06806.pdf)

After talking with Sottile, direction forward will be for exploring...


Consider two spaces, one for the geographic location, one for opinion space.

Each person is placed at a point in both graphs.

Geography determines who interacts with who.
  - these interactions affect the opinion graph
Opinions
  - location in opinion graph effect determine where people move

Actual interactions are derived from the graph
  - Could be fuzzy graph? Create 1-factor some how.

Is movement based on complete graph? Or do we want to limit it in similar way to opinion interaction?
